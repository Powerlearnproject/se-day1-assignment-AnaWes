Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Soft ware engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software.
Enhances security by implementing protection practices such as encryption.
Allows for flexibility as it ensures system cab handle increased load without affecting performance.
Reliable as it performs expected tasks without bias.
Promotes efficiency as it helps optimize workflow while maintaining high quality standards.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering complexity.
Mastering process.
Mastering machine.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning -identifying software requirement or purpose and scope.
Requirement analysis -Identify the final user specifocation.
Design-building framework.
Coding -converting software design into tangible code.
Testing -examine the software for any bugs

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology -linear and sequsntial ,each phase is completed before moving on.
Has low flexibility, customer feedback is late, testing is done at the end of the development process.
Agile methodology - high flexibility, regular feedback, testing is continuous and done after each step .

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer -developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages framework .
Quality assurance engineer - collaborate with stake holders to understand and clarify software requirement.
Project manager - assembles and lead the software development team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated development systems (IDEs)-is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write ,compile and debug code ,sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts.eg visual studio code 
Version control system (VCS)-are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time .eg Git 
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Time constraints - the field is demanding hence toght deadlines leading to high pressure,adile methodologies should be adopted.
Limited infrastructure - limited tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage structures, software engineers should rely on robhs structures.
Rapid technology advancement making it hard to keep up and hence pressure to stay current, should adopt continuous learning practices and emerging trends. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests- are close to source of an application and consist of testing individual methods and functions of classes, components,or modules used by software.
Intergration tests- verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
System testing - focuses on ghe entire software system as a whole, including qll functionalities and interactions.
Acceptance tests- formal tests to verify if a system satisfies business requirements.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
It improves user experience by obtaining relevant results.
Increased flexibility as it can create propmts with domanin- neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Draw a picture of a house .
Draw a  picture of a four bedroom mansion with an open field and electric fences in a gated community.
The improved prompt gives more clarity and precision hence warranting the best required results.
